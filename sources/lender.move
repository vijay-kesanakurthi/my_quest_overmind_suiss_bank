/* 
    This quest features a portion of a simple lending protocol. This module provides the functionality
    for users to deposit and withdraw collateral, borrow and repay coins, and calculate their borrowing
    health factor. This lending protocol is based on the NAVI lending protocol on the Sui network. 

    Lending protocol: 
        A lending protocol is a smart contract system that allows users to lend and borrow coins. 
        Users can lend out their coins by supplying the liquidity pools, and can borrow coins from the
        liquidity pools. 

        This module is the basis for an overcollateralized lending protocol. This means that borrowers
        need to have lended more coins than they are borrowing. This is to ensure that the lenders are
        protected. 

    Depositing: 
        Lenders can deposit their coins to the liquidity pools at anytime with the deposit function.
    
    Withdrawing: 
        Lenders can withdraw the coins that they have lended out with the withdrawal function.

        In production, the withdrawal function should ensure that withdrawing their collateral does 
        not result in the user's health factor falling below a certain threshold. More on this below.

    Borrowing: 
        Borrowers can borrow coins from any available liquidity pools with the borrow function.

        In production, the borrowing function should ensure that the borrower has enough collateral 
        to cover the borrowed amount. Ensuring that the health factor of this use is above a certain 
        threshold after the borrowing is typically good practice. More on this below.

    Repaying: 
        Borrowers can repay coins they have borrowed with the repay function.

    Admin: 
        Only the admin is able to create new pools. Whoever holds the AdminCap capablity resource can
        use create_pool to create a pool for a new coin type. 

    Health factor: 
        To learn more about the health factor, please refer to Navi's documentation on health factors 
        here: https://naviprotocol.gitbook.io/navi-protocol-docs/getting-started/liquidations#what-is-the-health-factor

        Note that the health factor should be calculated with a decimal precision of 2. This means that
        a health factor of 1.34 should be represented as 134, and a health factor of 0.34 should be
        represented as 34.

        Example: 
            If a user has 1000 SUI as collateral and has borrowed 500 SUI, and the price of SUI is $1,
            the health factor of the user would be 1.6 (returned as 160). This is with a liquidation
            threshold of 80% (see below).

            if a user has 1000 SUI and 34000 USDC as collateral and has borrowed 14000 FUD, and the 
            price of SUI is $7.13, the price of USDC is $1, and the price of FUD is $2.20, the health 
            factor of the user would be 1.06 (returned as 106). This is with a liquidationthreshold 
            of 80% (see below).

    Liquidation threshold: 
        In production, each coin can have it's own liquidation threshold. These thresholds are considered
        when calculating the health factor of a user.

        In this module, the liquidation threshold is hardcoded to 80% for every coin. 

        More information on liquidation thresholds can be found in Navi's documentation here:
        https://naviprotocol.gitbook.io/navi-protocol-docs/getting-started/liquidations#liquidation-threshold

    Liquidation: 
        In production, if a user's health factor falls below the liquidation threshold, the user's 
        collateral is liquidated. This means that the user's collateral is sold off to repay the borrowed
        amount. 

        In this module, the liquidation function is not implemented as it is out of scope. However, 
        being able to calculate the health factor of user is a crucial part of the liquidation process.

    Price feed:
        This module uses a dummy oracle to get the price of each coin. In production, the price feed 
        should be a reliable source of the price of each coin. 

        The price feed is used to calculate the health factor of a user.

        The price and decimal precision of each coin can be fetched from the price feed with the 
        get_price_and_decimals function. The coin's asset number is used to fetch the price and
        decimal precision of the coin.

    Decimal precision: 
        When relating USD values of different coins, it is important to consider the decimal precision
        of each coin. This is because different coins have different decimal precisions. For this quest, 
        we assume that the decimal precision of each coin is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

        The decimal precision of each coin is fetched from the price feed with the get_price_and_decimals
        function.
